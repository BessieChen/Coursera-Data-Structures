# Coursera-Data-Structures
In this course I learn the common data structures that are used in various computational problems, how these data structures are implemented in different programming languages and practice implementing them in our programming assignments. I understand what is going on inside a particular built-in implementation of a data structure and what to expect from it. I also learn typical use cases for these data structures.
